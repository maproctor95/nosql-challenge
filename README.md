# nosql-challenge
## Overview of Project

* Deliverable 1: A Jupyter notebook containing code that imports the data and sets up and updates the uk_food database.
* Deliverable 2: A Jupyter notebook containing code that performs the exploratory analysis queries in the database.
 
### Purpose

I am utilizing Jupyter Notebook and mongodb to analyze data from a JSON file in order to get more detailed information about what the pulled data shows.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

* During this assignment I was able to complete all the goals and objectives for the assignment. I used what I have learned in the class to trouble shoot the code as I went with Jupyter Notebook and made sure I was fully understanding what each part of my code did through labeling, so when an error popped up I knew how to approach the problem.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* I think the biggest challenge for me was figured out how to do the set up in terminal before I could start the jupyter notbook. I hit a lot of errors and road blocks, but breaks and repetition won over and eventually I figured out what I needed to do.
